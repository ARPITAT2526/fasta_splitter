# FASTA Splitter Script

This Python script reads multiple sheets from an Excel file containing FASTA-format sequences, splits each sequence, and saves them into individual `.fasta` files â€” organized by sheet name.

---

## ðŸ“‚ How It Works

- Takes an Excel file like `boladatabase.xlsx` with sheets named `DRB3`, `DQA`, etc.
- Each sheet contains FASTA data (headers starting with `>`).
- Splits and writes each sequence to a separate `.fasta` file in its respective folder.
